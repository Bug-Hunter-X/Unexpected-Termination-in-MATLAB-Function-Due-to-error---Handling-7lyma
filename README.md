This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to the improper use of the 'error' function within a custom function. The 'bug.m' file shows the problematic code, where an error is thrown without proper exception handling.  The 'bugSolution.m' file provides a corrected version that utilizes 'try-catch' blocks for robust error management and prevents unexpected program termination.
